Hello! My name's Enzo. I am a software engineer from Santiago, Chile.

I have been working in the software industry for over 10 years, with a focus on backend development and e-commerce platforms.
I specialize in the design and implementation of complex integrations (REST, GraphQL, SOAP), automating processes,
and developing software solutions in PHP, JavaScript, and Python, with a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and agile methodologies.

I am driven by technology's ability to improve processes and solve complex problems.
During my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from developing custom e-commerce solutions to integrating third-party services and building internal tools for process automation.
I have also worn different hats, from developer, consultant, project manager, and team leader.
This has given me a broad perspective on how to approach new situations and deliver value to clients and stakeholders.

I love to tackle new challenges that demand innovative and efficient solutions.
My experience has honed my ability to learn quickly and maintain a strong curiosity to stay at the forefront of technological trends.
That's why, when asked about what I would classify as my superpower, I always answer:

> I'm comfortable knowing that there are things that *I don't know*. But what I don't know, **I can learn**.

My personal goal is to advance to the role of Software Architect, where I can design robust systems that drive growth and optimize performance across various industries.

## Personal interests

I love playing board games. I have a collection of over 30 games, ranging from party games to heavy strategy.
I particularly enjoy the kind of games that take a while to set up and play, and then debate over 30 minutes before making a single move (Gloomhaven, anyone?).

I also enjoy video games. I have been playing since I was a kid, starting with the classic NES.
I attribute my love for video games to being able to learn english at a young age. At that time, games were not localized,
and if I wanted to know how to progress or what to do, there wasn't any option other than to grab a dictionary and start translating.
Those hard games definitely shaped my patience and problem-solving skills as well.

I also like to play airsoft. While I don't play as often as I would like, I enjoy the tactical aspect of the game and the camaraderie that comes with it.
